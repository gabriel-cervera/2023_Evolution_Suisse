# Background


Plant pathogens pose a global burden on agriculture, reducing harvest by up to 40% (American Phytopathological Society, 2023). Diseased crops not only lead to reduced yield and quality but ultimately impact the economy and environment (Martins et al., 2018; Savary et al., 2017). Currently, pesticides are used to protect crops, however, they negatively impact the environment and pose health risks to humans (Pathak et al., 2022). Therefore, developing pathogen-resistant crops remains a challenge that demands innovative solutions and research. 
This part might use some more numbers and genral talk about the problem.



Plant innate immunity relies on pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (Boutrot & Zipfel, 2017; Zipfel, 2014). Phytobacteria evade this immune response by introducing virulence proteins called effectors into plant cells via e.g. the type III secretion system to promote pathogenesis (Macho & Zipfel, 2015). As a result, residues on the interaction interfaces find themselves under high selective pressure, facilitating the fixation of interaction-disrupting mutations (Bishop et al., 2000; Bishop et al., 2005; Shabab et el., 2008).

This part could be more informative about PRRs in general, what they can do. 

Among the phytobacteria, Pseudomonas syringae ranks as the scientifically and economically most important bacterial pathogen worldwide (Mansfield et al., 2012). Strains of P. syringae are categorised into at least 50 pathovars and express a variety of effector proteins. One well-characterised effector of P. syringae is AvrPtoB. Besides P. syringae, members of the AvrPtoB protein family are also present in many other strains of Pseudomonas, and at least two other genera of bacterial phytopathogens, Xanthomonas and Erwinia (Oguiza & Asensio, 2005). In Arabidopsis thaliana, AvrPtoB targets the receptor kinase CERK1, which is responsible for chitin elicitor signalling and resistance to fungal and bacterial pathogens (Gimenez-Ibanez et al., 2009).  CERK1 consists of an extracellular domain with three tandem-LysM motifs, a transmembrane domain, a juxtamembrane domain, and an intracellular Ser/Thr kinase domain (Yang et al., 2022). AvrPtoB can repress chitin responses and overcome CERK1-mediated resistance by inhibiting the kinase activity and targeting CERK1 for degradation (Gimenez-Ibanez et al., 2009).

Here I would detail CERK1 quite a bit more. As well as AvrPtoB. Maybe do a fun: "Our players" part.

Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) is the oldest and one of the most popular genetic methods used to identify protein protein interactions in live yeast cells (https://doi.org/10.1038/340245a0). The crux of the method depends on the fact that transcription factors are modular in nature. Namely, they contain distinct activation (AD) and DNA-binding domains (DBD), responsible for activating transcription and binding promoter DNA sequences, respectively. However, crucial to the method, the AD cannot activate transcription unless it is physically associated with the DBD. One can exploit this by fusing AD to protein A (also called prey in the field) and DBD to protein B (also called bait). In case proteins A and B interact with each other, they will bring the AD and DBD close to one another, allowing for them to physically associate. Physically associating AD and DBD are then capable of activating a transcription of a select reporter gene, which contains the DBD binding motif (also called upstream activating sequence or UAS) within its promoter sequence. The reporter gene refers to a gene whose transcription has easily detectable results. For example, the activation of LacZ causes normally white yeast colonies to turn blue when grown on media containing X-gal, while the activation of Ura3 allows yeast to grow on media lacking uracil, an essential metabolite. What we described is the so called forward direction in the Y2H system which is, again, designed to detect protein-protein interactions. 

In theory, there is nothing preventing the use of a negative readout from the reporter gene as an indication of no interaction between two proteins. It was precisely this thinking that led to the development of the first reverse yeast two-hybrid (rY2H) method, aimed at selecting against protein-protein interactions (doi: 10.1093/nar/24.17.3341). The main change in the system was the use of a counterselectable reporter gene whose transcription and translation led to a toxic protein. As such, yeast which contained interacting proteins would die off, leaving only colonies harbouring non-interacting proteins. A final improvement merged the forward and reverse directions in a single system using the Ura3 reporter gene (doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.19.10315). On one hand, in a medium lacking uracil, Ura3 transcription is essential for growth. On the other hand, if one adds 5â€™-fluoroorotic acid (5FOA) to the medium, Ura3 transcription transforms it into a toxic metabolite, killing the cell. Therefore, one can use the same yeast strain, plating in on media lacking uracil to select for protein-protein interactions or on media with 5FOA to select against them.
