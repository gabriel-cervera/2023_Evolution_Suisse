# Background


## Threats to global food supply
With a rising global population and greater weather variability due to climate change, food insecurity has become increasingly problematic. Recent estimates by the American Phytopathological Society (2023) indicate a global reduction of up to 40% in crop yields due to pests and diseases. Another study shows the impact on specific crops, revealing wheat losses of 10-28%, rice losses of 25-41%, maize losses of 20-41%, potato losses of 8-21%, and soybean losses of 11-32% attributed to pathogens and pests (Savary et al., 2017).

These diseases negatively impact crop yield and quality, posing a substantial challenge for the agricultural sector (Martins et al., 2018; Savary et al., 2017), leading to an economic burden on agricultural economies and higher food prices.
The spread of plant diseases also leads to increased use of chemical pesticides, which is detrimental to soil health, water quality, and biodiversity. This makes the challenges for sustainable agriculture even tougher (Gunstone et al., 2021). 

For these reasons, developing crops with enhanced resistance to pathogens is indispensable to ensure food and economic stability. Creating more resistant crops requires a multi-disciplinary approach, including advances in genetic engineering and deepening knowledge of plant-pathogen interactions. 


## Plant immunity

Plant innate immunity relies on pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), membrane proteins that detect potential pathogens. They do this by recognizing specific molecules from pathogens, the so-called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Examples of PAMPs include flg22, a 22-amino-acid peptide from flagellin (the building block of flagella) of bacteria, and peptidoglycan and chitin from bacterial and fungal cell walls, respectively.
Upon detection of PAMPs, the PRRs trigger a defensive response within the plant to halt the pathogen's progression and spread (Boutrot & Zipfel, 2017; Zipfel, 2014). The immune response proceeds progressively, through multiple different pathways, depending on the sensed threat (Boller & Felix, 2009). The start of the response is characterised by changing ion fluxes, considerable production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the subsequent phosphorylation cascades. Out of these early responses, the ROS burst is of special importance as it can be easily detected and measured using luminol’s H2O2-dependent luminescence. Later stages of the immune response are mainly characterized by production of the stress hormone ethylene, immune gene activation, and callose deposition.
Phytobacteria can evade this immune response by introducing virulence proteins, called effectors, into plant cells via different secretion systems. The secretion systems function like elaborate hypodermic needles, injecting pathogen effectors into the plant cell, sabotaging the immune response from within. The mechanisms of effector action are very diverse (Macho & Zipfel, 2015) : HopAO1 dephosphorylates its target PRR, inactivating it in the process;  AvrPto binds its target PRR and prevents it from carrying out its normal function; AvrPphB acts as a targeted protease chopping its PRR target into pieces; AvrPtoB acts as an ubiquitin ligase, hijacking the plant protein degradation system target and destroy its own PRR.

Among the different phytobacteria, Pseudomonas syringae ranks as the most devastating bacterial pathogen worldwide (Mansfield et al., 2012). This pathogen produces a well-characterised effector called AvrPtoB, which targets the PRR CERK1, leading to the inhibition of the plant immune response. This receptor is effective at detecting chitin and peptidoglycan, originating from fungi and bacteria, respectively, providing a broad range of defensive recognition from multiple kingdoms (Ao et al., 2014). The disruption of CERK1 function leads to a ten-fold increase in pathogen proliferation, highlighting its crucial function in plant immunity. 
We decided to tackle these problems using directed evolution to evolve plant receptors and make them  less prone to diseases. With this we also hope to establish directed evolution as a viable method to disrupt protein-protein interactions across all realms.
