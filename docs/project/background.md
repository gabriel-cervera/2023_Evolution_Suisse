# Background


Plant pathogens pose a global burden on agriculture, reducing harvest by up to 40% (American Phytopathological Society, 2023). Diseased crops not only lead to reduced yield and quality but ultimately impact the economy and environment (Martins et al., 2018; Savary et al., 2017). Currently, pesticides are used to protect crops, however, they negatively impact the environment and pose health risks to humans (Pathak et al., 2022). Therefore, developing pathogen-resistant crops remains a challenge that demands innovative solutions and research. 
This part might use some more numbers and genral talk about the problem.



Plant innate immunity relies on pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (Boutrot & Zipfel, 2017; Zipfel, 2014). Phytobacteria evade this immune response by introducing virulence proteins called effectors into plant cells via e.g. the type III secretion system to promote pathogenesis (Macho & Zipfel, 2015). As a result, residues on the interaction interfaces find themselves under high selective pressure, facilitating the fixation of interaction-disrupting mutations (Bishop et al., 2000; Bishop et al., 2005; Shabab et el., 2008).

This part could be more informative about PRRs in general, what they can do. 

Among the phytobacteria, Pseudomonas syringae ranks as the scientifically and economically most important bacterial pathogen worldwide (Mansfield et al., 2012). Strains of P. syringae are categorised into at least 50 pathovars and express a variety of effector proteins. One well-characterised effector of P. syringae is AvrPtoB. Besides P. syringae, members of the AvrPtoB protein family are also present in many other strains of Pseudomonas, and at least two other genera of bacterial phytopathogens, Xanthomonas and Erwinia (Oguiza & Asensio, 2005). In Arabidopsis thaliana, AvrPtoB targets the receptor kinase CERK1, which is responsible for chitin elicitor signalling and resistance to fungal and bacterial pathogens (Gimenez-Ibanez et al., 2009).  CERK1 consists of an extracellular domain with three tandem-LysM motifs, a transmembrane domain, a juxtamembrane domain, and an intracellular Ser/Thr kinase domain (Yang et al., 2022). AvrPtoB can repress chitin responses and overcome CERK1-mediated resistance by inhibiting the kinase activity and targeting CERK1 for degradation (Gimenez-Ibanez et al., 2009).

Here I would detail CERK1 quite a bit more. As well as AvrPtoB. Maybe do a fun: "Our players" part.
